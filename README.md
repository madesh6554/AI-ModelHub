## 💡 Domains & Projects

### 🧠 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is used to analyze, interpret, and generate human language. Our NLP tools include:

- **Text Classification**: Automatically categorize texts (e.g., spam detection, topic labeling)
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract people, places, and organizations from text
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand emotions behind user-generated content
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries from long documents
- **Question Answering**: Answer questions using context from paragraphs

**Tech Stack:**  
OpenAI GPT, spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers

---

### 🎧 2. Audio / Speech Processing
Audio models convert spoken language into text and vice versa.

- **Speech-to-Text**: Convert user speech into written commands (powered by OpenAI Whisper)
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert AI-generated text into spoken audio (using pyttsx3 or gTTS)
- **Speaker Emotion Detection** *(optional feature)*: Analyze tone to determine speaker mood

**Use Cases:**  
Virtual assistants, accessibility tools, voice-operated systems

---

### 👁️ 3. Computer Vision
Computer Vision models analyze images and extract meaningful information.

- **Image Classification**: Detect object categories in images
- **Object Detection**: Identify and locate multiple objects in a frame
- **Face Detection & Emotion Recognition** *(optional features)*
- **Scene Understanding**: Use foundation models to explain complex visuals

**Libraries Used:**  
OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, MediaPipe

---

### 🤖 4. Generative AI
These models **generate new content** based on prompts.

- **Text Generation**: Create stories, summaries, or code using language models
- **Image Generation** *(optional)*: Generate images from text (e.g., DALL·E)
- **Style Transfer** *(Vision-to-Vision)*: Transform visual art into another style

**Backends:**  
OpenAI GPT, Gemini Pro, Hugging Face LLMs

---

### 🔀 5. Multimodal AI
Multimodal AI allows **multiple input types** (text + image + voice) to be processed simultaneously to produce intelligent responses.

#### 📌 This section is powered by two foundation models:
- **Google Gemini Pro Vision**
- **OpenAI GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V)**

#### 💻 Features:
- **Multiple Inputs Supported:**
  - 📷 **Image Upload**
  - ⌨️ **Text Input**
  - 🎙️ **Voice Input** (transcribed via Whisper)
- **Smart Response Generation**:
  - Combines image + question for insightful analysis
  - Handles OCR-like queries and content recognition
